To use justified button groups with <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> elements, <strong class="text-danger">you must wrap each button in a button group</strong>. Most browsers don't properly apply our CSS for justification to <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> elements,
but since we support button dropdowns, we can workaround that.
